#### [Freedom and Money by G.A. Cohen](https://alexandriathylane.com/philosophy/freedom-and-money-ga-cohen.html)
A simplified, section-by-section summary of *Freedom and Money* by political philosopher Gerald Allen Cohen.

Cohen criticizes liberal Rawls & Berlin for ceding to right-wing political philosophers by agreeing with the premise that lack of money is to suffer simply lack of means & not interference of freedom.

Instead, he challenges them on the conceptual grounds of their argument: He argues that poverty is in fact a lack of freedom.

Cohen claims money is an INUS condition for freedom & illustrates this using a hypothetical society with "access tickets" to various goods & services.

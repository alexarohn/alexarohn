#### [Emma Goldman, Woman Suffrage](https://alexandriathylane.com/philosophy/emma-goldman-woman-suffrage.html)
In _Woman Suffrage_ (published 1911), anarchist thinker and activist Emma Goldman (1869–1940), radically argues that women's suffrage is not a panacea for women's, and more broadly, society's, liberation. In fact, Goldman posits that it can sometimes serve as a distraction or even source of control.

#### [Justin Garson on the incoherence of innate biological traits, and proposing the robust-plastic continuum](https://alexandriathylane.com/philosophy/justin-garson-nature-and-nurture.html)

In chapter 4, _Nature and Nurture_, of Justin Garson's _The Biological Mind: A Philosophical Introduction_, Garson takes the nature/nurture debate head on.

Put briefly, Garson argues that the biological concept of "innateness" is confused, bordering on meaningless. Garson proposes that we instead distinguish traits along a robust/plastic continuum.

#### [Locke on property](https://alexandriathylane.com/philosophy/john-locke-on-property.html)
A simplified, section-by-section summary of *Chapter. V. Of Property*. from Locke’s *Second Treatise of Government*.

Locke argues that people come to acquire property rights by “mixing their labour” with natural resources. Locke includes two provisos: First, that “there is enough, and as good, left in common for others.” And second, that the person uses the resource before it spoils.

Locke’s _Second Treatise on Government_ has become a foundational text in liberalism and has shaped Western governance and individual rights. 

_Chapter. V. Of Property_ focuses on property rights and has had major influence on the development of capitalism and private ownership.

#### [Freedom and Money by G.A. Cohen](https://alexandriathylane.com/philosophy/freedom-and-money-ga-cohen.html)
A simplified, section-by-section summary of *Freedom and Money* by political philosopher Gerald Allen Cohen.

Cohen criticizes liberal Rawls & Berlin for ceding to right-wing political philosophers by agreeing with the premise that lack of money is to suffer simply lack of means & not interference of freedom.

Instead, he challenges them on the conceptual grounds of their argument: He argues that poverty is in fact a lack of freedom.

Cohen claims money is an INUS condition for freedom & illustrates this using a hypothetical society with "access tickets" to various goods & services.

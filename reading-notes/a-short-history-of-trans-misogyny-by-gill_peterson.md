# Gill-Peterson, Jules, “A Short History of Trans Misogyny”
# Introduction: Femmes against Trans
The term “trans” is promoted by the Global North and meant to be inclusive and boundary-crossing but carries the risk of oversimplifying diverse identities.

>We are living in the global era of trans, a shortened or prefixal version of the word transgender. As an umbrella promoted by the global North, trans is a hyper-inclusive category under which a constellation of gender identities and styles are meant to find their home. As a prefix, trans- is also a kind of boundary-crossing energy, a refusal to be contained by binaries, and attachable to nearly anything: not just people around the world in countless cultures and languages, but also animals, molecules of animate matter, or digital technology.

>Prefixal trans politics promise a queer utopia of gender in which everyone else is set free by getting rid of a backward trans womanhood. This is an origin story that is rarely told.

The word ”transgender” rose to popularity in the 1990s in two distinct but related births:
>a largely white activist world in the San Francisco Bay Area, where people long involved in queer organizing began to rally around transgender as a nonmedical, avowedly political category for trespassing the enforced boundaries of gender.

- Swaths of people in the United States who had previously traveled under disparate and even incompatible signs were suddenly lumped together under a single umbrella, including transvestites, drag queens, cross-dressers, street queens, hair fairies, butches, studs, bois, faggots, femmes, gender fluid and genderfuck people, and transsexuals.

>But the far bigger shadow cast by transgender came through its second birth in the well-funded NGO industrial complex. There, transgender was institutionalized by social service organizations working in US cities and was swiftly adopted for parallel international development work across the global South.

- Street girls and sex workers dismissed the transgender label. The term “gay” was one particular sticking point, with orgs wanting to separate gender and sexuality.

>Transgender’s great accomplishment has thus been to disavow the very people it claims to urgently represent: poor women of color.

>A Short History of Trans Misogyny tells a story in four acts that valorizes the experience, genius, and desires of trans women and trans femininity in the face of misogyny, racism, poverty, and state violence.

The term “trans-feminized” is used to describe groups subjected to transmisogyny despite their not identifying with the transgender identity. (e.g. Hijra, Two-Spirit people, street queens, etc.)

The book tells a series of global stories from the early 19th century to the present day. The word global is meant to highlight how colonialism and capitalism have devastatingly standardized diverse peoples and cultures.

> without a clear understanding of what distinguishes trans misogyny from broader misogyny, or its connections to homophobia, we risk collapsing the political differences between trans and non-trans women, as well as leaving the door open to trans-exclusionary feminists to characterize trans women as “privileged males” who don’t experience misogyny at all.

>Trans misogyny formed first as a mode of colonial statecraft that modeled for individuals how to sexualize, dehumanize, and aggress trans-feminized people through panic, beginning with police officers.

Historically, gender and sexuality, or what is gay and what is trans feminine, have been blurred for most people.

This book investigates three of trans misogyny’s most enduring manifestations: 1) trans panic, 2) the downward mobility of embracing womanhood under wage-labor capitalism, 3) the betrayal of trans-femininity in the post-Stonewall gay movement.
- Ch. 1, ”The Global Trans Panic,” narrates the emergence of state violence from the 19th century until 2020. Moral panics targeting trans feminine people were a form of statecraft.
- Ch. 2, “Sex and the Antebellum City,” asks why trans womanhood is so strongly associated with sex work. The answer comes in the remarkable life of Mary Jones.
- Ch. 3, “Queens of the Gay World,” studies street queens and how gay and lesbian political movements ultimately betrayed trans femininity in the 1970s to secure their respectability as men and women. The 1970s was also when Western feminism had a falling out with trans women.
- “This book’s conclusion, ‘Mujerísima and Post-scarcity Feminism,’ poses a bold new trans feminism for the twenty-first century and critiques the flaccid trans misogyny of the present in both anti-trans feminism and queer and trans movements.”

>This book gives little space to trans-exclusionary feminism because it has had far less impact on trans women and trans-feminized people than colonialism, the policing of public space, the criminalization of sex work, and the betrayal of street queens.

>It’s also untrue that American feminists, even lesbian feminists, were solidly anti-trans in the 1970s. Recent work by historians has cast doubt on how popular TERF beliefs ever were outside of a few loud agitators—

# 1. The Global Trans Panic
### The targeting of South Asian Hijra for British statecraft
The global trans panic had no single architect or origin, but traces of its emergence are archived during the 19th century in Northwestern Provinces of colonial India.

In 1852, a hijra named Bhoorah was murdered, and her lover, Ali Buksh, was charged with the crime. The court, via Judge Unwin, declared Bhoorah had been a prostitute and alerted colonial officials to what he considered an immoral hijra underground and the Bhoorah's death as the tip of the iceberg of a "eunuch problem."

>In truth, hijra history is extremely long, complex, and difficult to reconstruct. But in the mid-nineteenth century, hijras were found throughout the subcontinent. They were known for performing in public, mostly by dancing and singing. And they demanded badhai, gifts of money to which they were spiritually entitled at the birth of a child, or a marriage. The role of hijras in blessing and supporting the reproduction of the household was tied to their unique and sacred infertility.

Hijras were born male and initiated into a discipleship through which they lived as girls. They were popularly associated with castration, but not all in the 1850s underwent surgery.

>hijras were one of many types of ascetics throughout the subcontinent who lived, at times, at a great distance from British notions of gender, family, and religion.

Hijras were not then, and are not today, transgender. They were pulled into orbit of the Western gender system by the global trans panic.

>In short, this chapter argues that the violence of a trans panic made hijras trans feminine in the eyes of the British. Over time, colonial trans-femininization began to alter hijras’ self-perceptions, but that process trailed the immediate disruption of their way of life.

The British Empire used the rhetoric of moral reform to justify their colonization efforts, crusading under the cause of ending the global sex trade.

>The idea that hijras were male prostitutes with a secret government became the pretext for a statewide campaign to secure moral order by exterminating them.

In 1871, the colonial government passed the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA), the second half of which set out procedures targeting hijras and making their entire way of life illegal.

Hijras were treated differently from Indian sex workers, a difference that starts to explain what constitute trans panic. Unlike women sex workers, hijras were considered to be engaged in "professional sodomy," adding a loaded moral outrage.

In 1870, two "men" in London were arrested and charged as sodomites for simply wearing women's clothing. The Boulton and Park case helped cement the link between crossdressing and sodomy.

The CTA wasn't very successful as many hijras were able to evade its enforcement and its implementation withered by the end of the 19th century.

>Although the intervening history is too complex to reduce to any one cause, the British trans panic in the colonial era seems to have played a lasting role in sexualizing hijras and actually pushing them toward sex work by criminalizing their previous way of life. Thus, through the policing and economic disruption brought about by trans panic, what began as an accusation and a British fiction became the condition of many hijras.

Hijras became targets for violence by men, namely police officers. Their sexualized femininity became the target for violent punishment in a way that would recur countless times around the world in a similar pattern.

### US targeting of Indigenous Badé (Two-Spirit people)
In the 1870s in the US, federal agents began entering Indigenous communities confined on reservations to enforce laws banning practices the settler state considered threats to its sovereignty.

Badé (sometimes spelled baté) is a Crow word for a respected social role that today might fall under the Two-Spirit category.

Badé were incarcerated, had their hair cut off, and were made to wear men's clothing.

Two-Spirit people across the Americas, babaylan of the Phillippines, and mahu of Hawaii were targeted as trans-feminized "sodomites" under colonial expansion.

>What was trans about the panic was not that the people being targeted themselves were inherently trans women, but that they were trans-feminized by the conflation of male femininity with immoral sodomy and sex work.

>The fact that the state’s enforcers were policemen in each case is also important. After all, the global trans panic was not only about the general violence waged against populations now trans-feminized by the state; the panic also inaugurated the killability of trans women on an interpersonal scale. A new relationship between men and trans femininity was taking shape, leading to a world in which trans panic would eventually become the legal defense it remains today.

### American "fairies" & the working class: Jennie June, Loop the Loop, and Nancy Kelly
Jennie June (1874–?) was a self-identified "androgyne" who lived her life as a woman in the United States. She is notable for being one of the first people to write extensively about her experience as a trans feminine person, publishing _The Autobiography of an Androgyne_ in 1918 and _The Female-Impersonators_ in 1922.

>By 1895, according to June, working-class men in New York knew what trans femininity looked like, and some of them actively desired girls like her precisely because they were trans. Trans femininity was not only publicly visible in certain neighborhoods; it was seen as different from generic womanhood.

>In this era, especially in the working-class world, what is now conventionally separated out in American culture as “gender” and “sexual orientation” were a single category. Seemingly, men killed fairies and trans women for largely the same reasons: their sexualized femininity.

>The “fairies,” as they were popularly called, were recognizable by their waxed eyebrows, powdered cheeks, bright colors, and effeminate body language or speech. Unlike the idea of “same-sex” or homosexuality, it was their difference from men, their femininity, that advertised their availability. Regular men could have sex with fairies without suffering the loss of their masculinity and being considered queer, because fairies were effeminate—culturally legible replacements for women. As long as men played the active role when having sex with fairies, they weren’t regarded as any more unusual than men who paid for sex with women. This cultural norm lasted surprisingly long, well into the 1940s.

Loop the Loop (named after the Coney Island roller coaster) was a fairy and sex worker who lived full time in women's clothing. She could be described more closely as a trans woman by contemporary standards.

Nancy Kelly was a Black female impersonator working in the Chicago South Side drag circuit of the 1940s. She worked local clubs as a dancer, where a single good night could earn her forty dollars— compared to the twelve dollars a week she earned at her day job as a dishwasher, where Kelly dressed as a man

>For that kind of money, \[Kelly] was willing to risk the danger of working and going out in public dressed as a woman. For Kelly, femininity was a matter of economics, not the expression of an inner identity.

>The stories of these working-class fairies don’t clarify the difference between homosexuality and trans femininity. While Loop the Loop was more recognizably like a contemporary trans woman, Nancy Kelly was more like a gay man who only got up in drag for pay. According to the logic of trans panic, however, this difference was unimportant. What they had in common was an opportunity for a certain kind of life in the overcrowded, overpoliced working-class neighborhoods of New York City and Chicago. Trans femininity was not an expression of an inner gender identity but rather a mode of public appearance that paid, whether through sex work or dancing in a nightclub.

Trans panic born in the 19th century was a phenomenon with a global reach, via both colonial state power and interpersonal street interactions.

>Panic and trans-feminization produced similar experiences for vastly different kinds of people around the world who had little in common—other than being targets. The men who picked up fairies on the street, or who paid to see female impersonators dance in nightclubs, acted out the same structure of violence when they threatened, assaulted, or robbed them as the colonial state in India or the settler-colonial state in America. This was the same violence wielded by municipal police forces that raided bars and locked people up for cross-dressing. The blending of state violence with interpersonal violence is a signature outcome of the global trans panic, a deadly merger that persists to this day.

### Joseph Pemberton's murder of Filipino trans woman Jennifer Laude
On October 11, 2014, US Marine Joseph Pemberton murdered Jennifer Laude, a Filipina transgender woman, in Olongapo, Philippines.

The US initially refused to give up Pemberton:
>The 1998 Visiting Forces Agreement between the two countries, a central plank of American imperialism in a former colony, granted the US jurisdiction over lawbreaking servicepeople.

Trans and anticolonial activists protested and demanded the end of US military presence and imperialism. In late November, a murder charge was formally filed and Pemberton was transferred to joint US-Philippine custody. In December, 2015, Pemberton, utilizing the trans panic defense and reducing the charge from murder to homicide, was sentenced to 6-12 years in prison. Tragically, in September of 2020, far-right Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte granted Pemberton a pardon.

### CeCe McDonald
On June 5, 2011, CeCe McDonald, a Black transgender woman, and her friends were attacked by a group hurling transphobic and racist threats. One of them, Dean Schmitz, was wielding a broken beer bottle. McDonald defended herself with a pair of fabric scissors, resulting in Schmitz's death.

McDonald was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, sparking outcry from LGBTQ+ and racial justice activists who argued that she acted in self-defense. In May 2012, she pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of second-degree manslaughter and served 19 months in prison.

>“My idea,” \[McDonald] explained in one letter, “is that when a man’s ego and reputation are at stake, they fold into the pressure of society’s idea of what masculin/ity is. For me, it comes off as if femininity, homosexism, or transgenderism is contagious and that the man’s masculinity is jeopardized with the association of the fem-man and/or (trans)woman.”

Laude’s and McDonald’s stories dramatize three key features of the subject of this book. These features highlight the role social and state forces play a role in trans panic and its violence:
1. Trans misogyny is part of an expression of a perceived killability of trans women and larger state-sponsored pattern of violence.
2. Killers are often successful in claiming that the killing of trans women is rational.
3. Trans misogynist violence is interpreted as a legitimate response to "trans panic."

### Closing 
Trans-feminizing violence and trans misogyny are not limited to those who explicitly identify as trans women. Instead, this violence targets a broader range of individuals perceived as deviating from normative gender expectations, particularly those who appear feminine but are classified as male. This broader targeting suggests that the violence is less concerned with specific identities and more with policing and punishing gender nonconformity in general, especially as sanctioned by the state.

• Trans misogyny and historical trans panic have forced trans women into informal economies like sex work, limiting their life opportunities.
• Stereotypes and anti-sex-work feminism often misrepresent sex work among trans women as purely degrading, ignoring the nuanced, sometimes chosen nature of this work.
• Ethnographic research shows that Black trans sex workers integrate sex work with other types of labor, situating it within broader economic strategies and reflecting similarities with non-trans Black women’s experiences.

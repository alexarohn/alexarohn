#### [_Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory_ by Judith Butler (1988)](https://alexandriathylane.com/reading-notes/performative-acts-gender-constitution_butler.html)

Judith Butlerâ€™s 1988 essay argues that gender is not a natural or stable identity but a performative act. Drawing from phenomenology and feminist theory, Butler challenges the binary and essentialist notions of gender, claiming it is continuously constituted through repeated acts, gestures, and behaviors. This performativity creates the illusion of a coherent gender identity.
